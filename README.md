# Advent_code_2024

It is a challege for me: Advent Code 2024 exercises. Every day of the advent calendar has two parts, two exercises. Here I copy the link about what is it about: https://adventofcode.com/2024/about

They are solved with java. I am sure that there are more optimal ways to solve them. But I am learning and practising so it is the way that I solved them.

I upload the files with the inputs text for every day (ejercicioDia1.txt, ejercicioDia2.txt, etc)
